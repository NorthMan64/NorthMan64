Hey, I’m @NorthMan64. I was a student at CVUT FIT specialization in Software engineering (web development). Didn't get to finishing my degree. Now I work as a Software Engineer at NETWORG, company specializing in MS Power Apps development.

Currently enjoying working on my side projects pretaining to genetic algortihms, AI, ecosystems, and such.
